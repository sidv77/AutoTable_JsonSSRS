<h3>Instructions for installing Xselerator</h3>
<p>
Unzip into a root dir in your C:\ drive. Yes it a windows app. You do not need to run any install, unzipping is sufficient.
Right-click the Xselerator.exe, and click the Compatibity tab. Select Windows 7.
</p>

Also select Run as Administrator.

I also always get the message box "CoCreate failure on IAltovaApplication" on start. Just click ok, and ignore it, Xselerator.exe works fine. 
Strange - I even get this on machines that do not have Altova XmlSpy installed.

It has been a while since I installed Xselerator on a fresh machine. 
I do seem to recollect getting another message but can't for the life of me remeber what it was.

If there's any interest I'll update with additional recommendations in the comments.
